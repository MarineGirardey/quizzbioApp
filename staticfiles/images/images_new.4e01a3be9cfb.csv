23;39139;Receptor mediated endocytosis is a process in which extracellular molecules are taken into the cell via coated vesicles that pinch from the plasma membrane. In Paramecium the resulting vesicles fuse with flattened cisterna called early endosomes. Early endosomes accumulate just under the cortex of the cell. Sorting of proteins destined to be returned to the plasma membrane after separating from cargo occurs in the early endosomes and is facilitated by the formation of secondary coated pits and vesicles on the early endosomes that are smaller than the coated and uncoated preendosomal vesicles that arise from the plasma membrane. These small coated pits pinch off and subsequently lose their coats to form carrier vesicles that are roughly 100nm in diameter. These vesicles move deeper into the cell where they bind to microtubular ribbons. TEM taken on 11/4/68 by R. Allen with Philips 300 operating at 60kV.

In this image, CSS appears to be crossing a sieve pore in the phloem sieve plate. CIL:19128, from the same image group, is a labeled version of this image.  CSS is a wall-less procaryote that causes corn stunt disease and is biologically transmitted by some leafhopper species, e.g. Dalbulus maidis and D. gelbus (Hemiptera, Cicadellidae). Spiroplasma cells are limited by a unit membrane with no cell wall. They can be quasi-spherical, pleiomorphic or maintain a filamentous/spiral form. CSS multiplies in both plant and insect hosts and is transmitted with salivary secretions during feeding of the vector on new host plants.

The first shows an indentation in the cell membrane, the withdrawal of the pseudopodia tip and the subsequent rupture of the membrane in the area indented by the amebic tip.

The elimination of the intercellular gap (approx 90 angstroms) is clearly visible, but the fusion line of the two apposed membranes cannot be clearly distinguished at this magnification. The adherens junction (also known as zonula adherens) is the next structure. A relatively wide intercellular space (approx 200 angstroms) is maintained throughout this junction. Extensive actin filament networks are seen along both sides of the junction which are continuous with the terminal web into which the filamentous rootlets of the mircovilli penetrate. Dense material can be seen along parts of both sides of the junction. The limits of a desmosome are marked by the edges of the dense plaques. Desmosomes are characterized by a wide intercellular space (approx 240 angstroms) bisected by an intermediate line. Bundles of intermediate filaments (diameter approx 80 angstroms) converge into a dense plaque on each side of the desmosome.

Fawcett M.D.  This electron micrograph shows the supranuclear region of an odontoblast from a rat incisor, as this cell is actively secreting dentin matrix.  The accumulating product of protein synthesis by the rough endoplasmic reticulum is evident as a flocculent material in the lumen.  Image by Melvyn Weinstock.

Fawcett M.D.  The typical structural organization of mitochondria is revealed in this longitudinal section of a mitochondrion and surrounding cytoplasm from pancreas of the bat, Myotis lucifugus.  It is bounded by a smooth outer membrane about 7nm thick. An inner membrane has infoldings called cristae that project into the interior of the organelle.  Image by Keith Porter.

119;11443;"The internal structure of mitochondria can change in response to physiological demand.  Here, after the Sheepshead minnow Cyprinodon variegatus was kept in constant light for 4 weeks, mitochondria from cells of the pseudobranch acquired an additional category of tubular cristae arranged in rows between the longitudinally oriented foliate cristae.  Inset: a longitudinal section suggests these cristae have a helical tubular organization.

Fawcett M.D.  Mitochondrial density, and the number of cristae per mitochondrion are related to energy demands of each particular cell type and tissue.  In the upper figure, epithelial cells from mouse are moderately active, and thus this mitochondrion has an average number of lamellar cristae.  In the lower figure, rapidly contracting skeletal muscle from cricothyroid muscle of the bat has high energy requirements.  Correspondingly, this mitochondrion contains many long and closely packed cristae.
